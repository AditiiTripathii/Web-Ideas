- When you think about how to create a portfolio, you should always keep in mind that your portfolio has to be easy to navigate.

  Creating categories and dividing your work into segments makes it much easier for a person browsing through a portfolio website 
  to better understand your portfolio and the most important aspects of your work.

  So before creating your free online portfolio, try visiting other portfolio sites to see both good and bad online portfolio 
  examples and the categories people use most often to classify their work.
  
# Make Your Own Website
You can easily make your own website with the help of portfolio website templates, free website design, and website design inspiration you’ve collected so far.

However, you should also consider hiring one of the professional builders to make sure that you’ll end up with one of the best portfolio websites out there. Just keep in mind that hiring a pro comes with a price.

Find the best graphic design portfolio or the best web developer portfolio is the beginning or finding the right person to do a good job for you.

# You Need a Domain Name

If you want to build your website, you’re going to need your own domain name. It is not a must, but it will prove itself very helpful with your branding and marketing.

It also adds that little extra edge to your business and makes you seem more passionate about the work you do which automatically helps to build your credibility and
creates an image of a trustworthy and strong brand, person, or company.

# Search Engine Optimization

If you truly want a top portfolio website, simply creating one isn’t enough. You also need to make sure that people can find it so optimizing it for search
engines is a must!

Personal portfolio websites that are impossible to find on Google are mostly just a waste of your time and resources.

# Have Vision and Mission

Before you start creating your web portfolio, you should know your vision and mission, or at least the clear reason why you decided to create this portfolio in the first place.

Once you know what message you want your portfolio to send, you can start creating it. For example, interior design portfolio is not going to look the same as a graphic designer portfolio or web designer portfolio.

Know your clients, consider your objectives, and then build your portfolio accordingly.

# Choose Projects with Best Results

When building your portfolio website, be selective. There is no need to list every single detail and ever insignificant project from your past.

Choose projects with best results and put them on display, preferably divide them into categories to make the portfolio more organized.

# Keep it Concise
